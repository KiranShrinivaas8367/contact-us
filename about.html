            <h1>About us..</h1>
            <p>
                The endless source of knowledge, information, entertainment, and training are books. Before the age of the internet,
                books were the most dominating source of knowledge. But of course, with technology, the forms of books have changed,
                and books have become more accessible to everyone.
                For general knowledge about anything, we seek books like encyclopedias, atlas, and dictionaries. 
                And then there are also those books that guide us while we are dealing with certain tasks like cookbooks, 
                travel books, self-help books, etc.
                A book is a medium of spreading knowledge. They are also the best medium of studies. As some books are just for entertainment,
                some are to learn, some should be applied in our lives. The motives of different books are different. Francis Bacon has very
                well described books in his essay ‘Of Studies’. 
                He said -
                “Histories make men wise; poets witty; the mathematics subtle; natural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend”.
